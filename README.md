## Featured Projects (Private)

These are flagship systems I’m building. The repositories are private, but I can share demos or walkthroughs on request.

### 1) AI Document Assistant (RAG)
**Repo (private):** https://github.com/AkamAzizi/ai-knowledge-assistant  
A document intelligence assistant that answers questions across internal PDFs/notes using **RAG** (retrieval + grounded generation).  
**Highlights:**
- Semantic chunking + embeddings + retrieval
- Source-grounded answers (citations / context)
- Designed for real workflows (upload → query → feedback)
**Tech:** Python, FastAPI, embeddings, vector database, LLMs  
**Status:** Private — demo available on request

### 2) Offert AI (Proposal / Quote Generator)
**Repo (private):** https://github.com/AkamAzizi/Offert-Ai  
An AI-powered quote/proposal generator that turns structured inputs into consistent customer-ready outputs.  
**Highlights:**
- Template-driven output (PDF / Word-ready structure)
- Guardrails for tone and formatting
- Fast iteration for different industries (construction, services, consulting)
**Tech:** (Add your stack: e.g., Next.js, Node, Python, PDF generation, LLMs)  
**Status:** Private — demo available on request

### 3) CAD-MVP (Multi-Agent CAD Automation)
**Repo (private):** https://github.com/AkamAzizi/CAD-MVP  
Multi-agent pipeline for CAD automation: analyzes assemblies and supports engineering outputs and downstream documentation workflows.  
**Highlights:**
- CAD parsing + structured reasoning
- Multi-agent orchestration for complex tasks
- Focus on reliability and repeatable outputs
**Tech:** Python, FreeCAD, multi-agent orchestration, (add storage/UI if relevant)  
**Status:** Private — demo available on request
